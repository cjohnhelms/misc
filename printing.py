# rint is a funtion. when calling a function, provide arguments inside parenthses
# hello World in a string literal, so it must be enclosed in single or double quotes

print('Hello World!')

# functions can take more than one argument

print(1 + 2)
print(7 * 6)

print("The End","...or is it?","Now this is the end.")

# a couple more examples. even when not providing an argument, you need parentheses 
# separate multiple arguments with a comma
