Follow along as I learn Python and Git

My name is Christopher Helms and I am going to be tracking my progress learning Python and Git here in this Guthub repository. At the time of writing this I am a Technical Support Representative with a CompTIA A+, Network+ and an RHCSA, while working on AWS and Kubernetes certifications. I do most of my work from my Fedora Linux workstation. I am planning on enrolling at Austin Community College in the Spring of 2023 for an Associates of Science in Computer Science, with the possibility to transfer to a four year university. 

My workflow will mostly bounce between VSCode and the terminal. Due to my RHCSA, I am very comfortable in the Linux terminal and will be working with Git from the command line. Eventually that may change to using Git directly from VSCode, but for now I am working on building a strong foundation in both Python and Git. My commit messages will all be written with Vim.

This repository will feature both assignments/projects, as well as notes, so not every file may be the most interesting, however it serves as a learning tool for myself.
