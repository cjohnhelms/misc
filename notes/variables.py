# everything the program needs ends up stored in memory
# a variable is another way of giving a meaningful name to an area of memory where we can store values

# python variable names must begin with a letter (upper or lower) or an underscore character
# they can container letters, numbers, or underscores
# variables are created when bound to a value with an = 

age = 24
print(age)

# types:
# strings
# integers
# float (numbers with decimals)
# because python is dynamically typed, a variable can be giving one type (str) and be changed to an int later on in the same program

print(type(age))

# because python is strongly typed, you cannot contatinate multiple types of data

# print(age + ' years old') - this will not work
